(SIASL)² or siasl2 is the follow-up language to SIASL. 
Their design is somewhat similar but (SIASL)² is much richer. 
and has a important differences with SIASL.

Like SIASL (SIASL)² is a turing tarpit inspired by brainfuck. 

a program a set on instructions applied on a 2d grid. 
However, (SIASL)² doesn't work the way siasl does. 

An instruction/symbols in (SIASL)² is 2 characters instead of one. 

Some instruction/symbols  are predefined and are immutable some other can be user defined. 

To learn more about how (SIASL)² works and how to write (SIASL)² programs; please check out the 
docu/docu.html file.

This version of (SIASL)² isn't finished because it doesn't implement the (# and #) operators.
They will be implemented in the next version of the language.
