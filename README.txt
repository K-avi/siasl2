(SIASL)² or siasl2 is the follow-up language to SIASL. 
It's design is very similar. 

Like SIASL (SIASL)² is a turing tarpit inspired by brainfuck. 

a program is also a set on instructions applied on a 2d grid. 
However, (SIASL)² doesn't work the way siasl does. 

An instruction in (SIASL)² is 2 symbols instead of one. 

Some symbols are predefined and immutable some other can be user defined. 

I will explain how (SIASL)² works in details later when I'll write proper 
documentation for the language.

Btw: the (SIASL)² name is a pun with SIASL (which stands for Siasl Is A 
Silly Language ; which is already it's own pun) and the fact that each 
expression in (SIASL)² is 2 siasl expression and (SIASL)² is a way to write
the REGEX that describes that (it's not a very good pun)
