SIASL : 
    -will support 13 base instructions; 
    -parsers using flex/bison : 
        - brainfuck like parser 
       
    -command line and file interpreter 


(SIASL)² 1.0: 
    -will support default combined instructions 
    -BF-like parser; hex parser

(SIASL)² 2.0: 
    
    -will support defining behavior for symbols
    -might support redefining behavior for some existing symbols (oh boy!)


support to define behavior: 

internal support: 

    create table where set instructions are stored

parser support : 

    something like 

    openpar symbol stmts closepar 

    make sure that stmts ARE NOT EXECUTED

    and that u add symbol and stmts to the internal structure


test functions in macro.c ; 
add non-default symbol support in exec
 
figure out parsing of in bison

parsing : defun should prolly return a tableentry 

in stmts or wrapper of it should happen stuff to a table initialised when beginning parsing 

how will defun behave when u switch the flow of execution ????????????


-handle redefinitions of symbols; 
-realloc in tables ; maybe used linked lists instead of dynamic arrays???

-update docu
