SIASL : 
    -will support 13 base instructions; 
    -parsers using flex/bison : 
        - brainfuck like parser 
       
    -command line and file interpreter 


(SIASL)² 1.0: 
    -will support default combined instructions 
    -BF-like parser; hex parser

(SIASL)² 2.0: 
    
    -will support defining behavior for symbols
    -might support redefining behavior for some existing symbols (oh boy!)
        -> it won't 


support to define behavior: 

internal support: 

    create table where set instructions are stored

parser support : 

    something like 

    openpar symbol stmts closepar 

    make sure that stmts ARE NOT EXECUTED

    and that u add symbol and stmts to the internal structure


test functions in macro.c ; 
add non-default symbol support in exec
 
figure out parsing of in bison : done

parsing : defun should prolly return a tableentry  : done

in stmts or wrapper of it should happen stuff to a table initialised when beginning parsing 
-> no; done differently

how will defun behave when u switch the flow of execution ????????????
-> it won't do shit that's what it'll do

-handle redefinitions of symbols;
-> think it works???

-realloc in tables ; maybe use linked lists instead of dynamic arrays or handle reallocs
-> done made them smaller and handle realloc 

-update docu
